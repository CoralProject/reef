##Cards Against Community

A game of conversation, moderation, and trolling for 4-6 players
Length of game: 20 minutes

**How to play** 

This is a game of role-playing and conversation. Players are given characters and goals for each round; if they achieve their goals, they get a point. The player with the most points at the end of five rounds is the winner.

One player does not compete in the game; that person is the designated Head of Community (HOC). This player deals out the cards, starts the timer, makes sure the timer is visible to all players, scores each round, and keeps note of the scores. The other players are all 
Community Members.

**Rules**

*No insults
*No personal attacks
*No physical contact

This is a game about mischievous trolling, not abuse. Any player at any time can stop the game immediately and ask everyone to calm down by using the word **HALT**. All players must agree to abide by this code of conduct.
