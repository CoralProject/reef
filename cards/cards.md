##About the game cards

**There are three types of cards.**

###Character Cards

These contain the roles that each community member will adopt for one round. 
Community Members must not deliberately share their roles and aims during a conversation round, or the Head of Community (HOC) will deduct five points from their score. If aplayer is uncomfortable with their character, or if they receive the same one twice in a row, the HOC will allow them to take a new card. The character they discard is placed back into the pack.

###Moderation Cards

These change the dynamic of a conversation by penalizing another player in a particular way. 
If you have a moderation card played against you, you must obey what it says for 30 seconds. 
It is your responsibility to track 30 seconds on the HOCâ€™s timer. 

You cannot play a moderation card yourself until your 30 second penalty has ended. 
Moderation cards cannot be played against the HOC.

**Topic Cards**

These set the topic of conversation for each round.
