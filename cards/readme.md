##Cards Against Community

* This is a card game about conversation, moderation, and trolling for 4-6 players
* Length of game: 20 minutes

###Why does this exist?

We created this game because we want more people to think about how moderation tools and community structures change users’ experiences online. We encourage you to take a few minutes at the end of each round to consider how each rule change shifts the game’s  dynamic, and the actions of each Community Member.
