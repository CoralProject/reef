## How to play 

**Round 1**

The HOC divides the Character Cards face up into two piles: Trolls and Non-Trolls. They turn the cards face down, shuffle each pile, take one Troll card, and then enough Non-Troll cards until the HOC has one Character Card for each Community Member.

e.g. if there are 4 Community Members, the HOC counts out 1 Troll card and 3 Non-Troll cards. 

The HOC shuffles these cards together, then deals them face down to the players, so that nobody knows who the troll is. 

The HOC then shuffles the Moderation cards and deals out one card to each player, face down. 

Community Members can now look at their two cards. They need to follow the role on their Character Card, and try to achieve the aim/s listed on the card while continuing a conversation.
 
When everyone has read and understood their cards, the HOC turns over a Topic Card, chooses a player who will open the conversation, and then starts a timer for two minutes. The timer should be visible by all players. 

The conversation begins, and each Community Member tries to fulfill the aims stated on their Character Card. 

During the conversation, anyone can play a Moderation Card to help them achieve their goals. 

At the end of two minutes, players can try to guess what roles each player had (there are no points for this.) The players all reveal their character cards, and the HOC gives them zero points, a half point or one point, depending on whether the HOC feels they fulfilled their character’s aims during the round.

###Round 2

The same as Round 1, except the HOC shuffles the Troll and Non-Troll cards together. Now nobody knows how many trolls there are. 

A rule change for this and the remaining rounds: if a community member has a Non-Troll role, thinks that they are in a group filled with Trolls, and sees no way of achieving their aims, they can ‘log out’ at any time. They leave the conversation and forfeit any points from the round, but they probably save their sanity.

###Round 3

Same as Round 2, except the HOC chooses one Community Member to be the Moderator. That person is the only player with Moderation Cards in this round; they receive the same number of cards as there are other Community Members.

e.g. There are five players. One is the HOC, so the Moderator receives four Moderation Cards.

The Moderator’s role, as scored by the HOC, is to maintain a pleasant and on-topic conversation. 

###Round 4

The same as Round 2, except that the person/people with the most points so far don’t get a Moderation Card, and the person/people with the fewest points get two. If all Community Members have the same number of points, make Round 4 identical to Round 2.

###Round 5

The HOC deliberately chooses the Character Cards for each Community Member, without showing them to anyone else. The goal is to change the group dynamic; if someone has been talking a lot, they should receive The Person of Few Words character. If one Community Member has mostly played Non-Trolls, give them a Troll Character Card. 

Players receive one Moderation Card each as with Rounds 1 and 2.

Ending the Game

The player with the most points is declared the winner. 

In the event of a tie, the HOC can declare more than one winner or give bonus points for particularly strong/terrible arguments.
