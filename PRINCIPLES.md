# Principles
Below is a list of principles for everything that we build.

The core team created it together at the start of the project. We've written them down so that, as we work on the details of what we're building, we don't lose sight of the things about which we care most. 

The precise meaning of each of these words is different for each product â€“ and so we define its meaning before we start coding each one.
