# The Coral Project Code of Conduct
_Updated 12/9/2015_


**We expect everyone contributing to The Coral Project to follow this code of conduct. That means the team, contractors we employ, contributors, as well as anyone posting to our public or internal-facing channels.**

We created it not because we anticipate any unacceptable behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team, and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.

We make this code public in the hopes of contributing to the ongoing conversation about inclusion in the tech, design, and media communities and encourage other teams to fork it and make it their own. 

We commit to enforce and evolve this code over the duration of the project.



## Expected behavior:



**Be supportive of each other.** Offer to help if you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of assistance (taking care not to be patronizing or disrespectful). If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous with your time; if you’re under a deadline, direct them to someone else who may be of assistance. Go out of your way to include people in team jokes or memes, recognizing that we want to build an environment free of cliques. 

**Be collaborative.** Involve your colleagues in brainstorms, sketching sessions, code reviews, planning documents, and the like. It’s not only okay to ask for help or feedback often, it’s unacceptable not to do so

**Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting critique.** Critique is a natural and important part of our culture. Good critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on goals and requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and receive criticism with grace. 

**Be humane.** Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication, especially remote communication, where opportunities for misunderstanding are greater. Use sarcasm carefully. Tone is hard to decipher online; make judicious use of emoji to aid in communication. 

**Be considerate.**

**Be tolerant.**

**Respect people's boundaries.**

**Do not make it personal.**




## Unacceptable behavior:



We are committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs. 

We expect that you will refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. 

Furthermore, any behavior or language which is unwelcoming—whether or not it rises to the level of harassment—is also strongly discouraged. Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of microaggressions—subtle put-downs which may be unconsciously delivered. Regardless of intent, microaggressions can have a significant negative impact on victims and have no place on our team. 

Other inappropriate behavior: 

Threats

Slurs

Pornography

Spam

Bullying 

Copyright infringement

Impersonation of someone else

Violating someone's privacy

**If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you or someone else inappropriately, please alert the project lead at andrewl@mozillafoundation.org**



## Reporting a problem



These guidelines are ambitious, and we’re not always going to succeed in meeting them. When something goes wrong—whether it’s a microaggression or an instance of harassment—there are a number of things you can do to address the situation. Depending on your comfort level and the severity of the situation, here are some suggestions:

**Address it directly.** If you’re comfortable bringing up the incident with the person who instigated it, pull them aside to discuss how it affected you. Be sure to approach these conversations in a forgiving spirit: an angry or tense conversation will not do either of you any good. If you’re unsure how to go about that, try discussing with your manager or with the people and culture team first—they might have some advice about how to make this conversation happen.

If you’re too frustrated to have a direct conversation, there are a number of alternate routes you can take.

**Talk to a peer or mentor.** Your colleagues are likely to have personal and professional experience on which to draw that could be of use to you. If you have someone you're comfortable approaching, reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to advise on how they would handle it, or direct you to someone who can. The flip side of this, of course, is that you should also be available when your colleagues reach out to you.

**Talk to Andrew or David.** We will work with you to help you figure out how to ensure that any conflict with a colleague doesn’t interfere with your work, in confidence if you would prefer.

**Talk to Dan Sinker.** Dan oversees the project. He can be contacted at dan@mozillafoundation.org

**If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact Dan with a concise description of your grievance.

### Guideline violations — 3 strikes method

_Note: 3 strikes methodology and language adopted from the Docker project._

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we
do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.

1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the
   behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.

2. Second occurrence: We will send you a private message with a warning that
   any additional violations will result in removal from the community.

3. Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we may need to delete or ban
   your account.

**Notes:**

* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don't do this, we'll
  have spam all over the place.

* Violations are forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won't hold a
  grudge.

* People who commit minor infractions will get some education, rather than
  hammering them in the 3 strikes process.

* The rules apply equally to everyone in the community, no matter how much
	you've contributed.

* Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature
	will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes or forgiveness.

* Contact abuse@docker.com to report abuse or appeal violations. In the case of
	appeals, we know that mistakes happen, and we'll work with you to come up with a
	fair solution if there has been a misunderstanding.
