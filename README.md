# The Coral Project

We are creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism.

We also collect, support, and share practices, tools, and studies to improve communities on the web.

_The Coral Project is a collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, [The New York Times](http://nytimes.com), and [The Washington Post](http://washingtonpost.com), and is funded by a grant from [the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](http://knightfoundation.org)._

For more information about us and to see our blog, please visit [our website](https://coralproject.net).
